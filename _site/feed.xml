They’ve become accepted as here to stay. Even the internet of things (lowercase) is accepted as fact—even if its potential is far from being realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still capitalize Big Data, though, as if we’re still not quite sure. Maybe that’s because capital Big emphasizes the data we collect today has increased by an order of magnitude. Science Daily reports 90 percent of the world’s data has been produced in the last two years.
That presents a Bigger challenge for companies trying to protect their information assets. Here are nine ways Big Data should affect your data backup and recovery strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 Data is your business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what industry, modern companies run on data. Without information systems, databases and analytics, most business would grind to a halt. Many would never have been created at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if your bank suddenly lost its databases. Of course, a bank has multiple (hopefully redundant) databases. But even the smallest business collects, processes and stores more vital information than ever. Whatever its size, not backing up that data makes the company vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 Compliance is mandatory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments regulate data use practices and storage for many industries. Regulations vary with the industry; for example, financial institutions must protect and maintain various transaction data for different time periods and in different formats. The healthcare industry must protect our private health data, too. But because the volume of data keeps rising, keeping it safe and intact is more critical than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3 Data volumes are exploding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it: All the data ever collected up to two years ago makes up just 10 percent of what we have today. As long as the number of IoT devices continues to rise, look for the wave of data to continue to build. Yet without an evolving approach to data protection, how will we recover that much data if disaster strikes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4 Location is everything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile workforce continues to grow, and BYOD (bring-your-own-device) is a fact of life. Data and content are now scattered wide on laptops, tablets and smartphones, not to mention file-sharing apps—whether they are company-issued or personal. Unless backup policies account for this, you can’t have a full recovery of this bigger data in the event you need one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5 Disasters happen, in all shapes and sizes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how prepared your infrastructure team may be, you’ll most likely face a disaster of some kind. It may be only a disk failure or power outage, but it could be a cyberattack or a natural disaster. With today’s enormous data volumes, failure of even a small device can be fatal, if the data isn’t protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6 Redundancy is key&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You build redundancy into your production systems, right? You also need redundancy in your data backup plan. After all, the more data you collect, the more you back up. But if the backup device or facility itself fails, what then? The key is to have multiple backup destinations, including the cloud. The cloud’s elasticity offers as much storage as you need. And if one backup should fail, the other can save you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7 All or nothing policies are out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Big Data’s explosion, your backup policy can no longer treat all data the same. Even with the cloud’s elasticity, you can’t afford to store everything, all the time. Assess your data sources, determine what needs to be backed up (or not), how often and for how long. Then create an appropriate backup policy for each type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#8 The right approach for today’s data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you using the same storage arrays as ten years ago? Static disk arrays won’t cut it with today’s Big Data volumes. And they certainly won’t handle backing up the in-memory databases running to handle that volume. The cloud—private, public or hybrid—offers potential solutions, depending on your data’s sensitivity and compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#9 Recovery and continuity are king&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data backups are important for recordkeeping and regulatory compliance, but we’ve already said a disaster is inevitable, small or large. When your business is offline, your sales website is unreachable or your data cables are cut, you can rack up losses fast. Recovering your data is as Important as backing it up. What good is a backup without a surefire way to bring back a failed system?&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, while consumer marketers use social media to interact with their customers, only 10 percent of B2B marketers feel they can articulate the business value of social media outreach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, you’d be hard-pressed to find any company with a sizable customer base that doesn’t agree that customer relationship management (CRM) applications are key to landing and keeping their customers.
There are tremendous opportunities to be had by leveraging your CRM data to better know—and serve—your customers. We’ve discussed these in industries like hotels and resorts and even casinos. It’s true for healthcare as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But tweets and posts can reveal far more about your prospects and customers than CRM data alone. What do you have to gain by combining the two— embracing a truly social CRM?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers are more than transactions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early CRMs handled (or at least tracked) a customer’s activities from the time they made their first purchase. After that transaction, the customer is “official”: he has a registered entry in the billing system. At this point, you have an obligation to not just invoice the customer, but to provide post-purchase and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such CRMs featured a ticketing system or integrated with such an application. Together these systems provided a consolidated view of every transaction and interaction you’ve had with each customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s CRMs go far beyond just transactions. Beside ordering, billing and support, they add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing communications and targeted campaigns
Sales funnel management
Follow-up communications
Nurturing during longer sales cycles (especially for B2B)
Upselling
In other words, they gather and use information from the very moment you identify someone as a potential prospect. Analysis of all of this data shows us which products they’ve bought, which they’ve returned, and which they’ve had satisfactory (or unsatisfactory) experiences with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this hindsight view, customers are still more than just what they buy. They are living, breathing creatures with preferences, likes, dislikes and a whole range of opinions that have nothing to do with your products and services. Or seemingly nothing. These qualities make up a complex persona, most of which your customer will never reveal in a phone call or a customer satisfaction survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the power and openness of social media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRM data is about transactions and other basic data about your customers. If the CRM also handles marketing campaigns, it may also tell you what initially attracted those customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media, on the other hand, is a different story. Social data is about those customers personally, not your products and sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On social media, your customers can reveal their true feelings about your products and services, your company’s ethics and social responsibility. Wouldn’t that be good information to have when refreshing your company’s marketing message? If your CRM was dialed into social media channels, you’d get this feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about your customers’ political inclinations? Their views on environmental issues? The economy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not think these types of opinions matter in your line of business, but you’d be wrong. People tend to buy from those they identify with. No, you can’t identify with every customer in these areas. But what if your CRM’s social media connection revealed a pattern in the views of your existing customers? Marketing to other prospects fitting into that pattern could be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it mean to your customer’s experience and satisfaction if your support personnel could break the ice on some small issue that matters to them? Social CRM can give them a hint on what these issues might be. True, you might not want your support engineers talking politics to your customers. But knowing whether they like basketball over football, or the weather, or some other non-business aspect of their lives can score a life-long customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your CRM social yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, social media can help you monitor customer sentiment about your own products, too. What if you detected a sudden rant on Twitter about your service delivery and stepped in to ensure your staff was already working on the problem? Think how much brand damage might be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your CRM tied into social media yet? Paranet knows how critical it is to have a social connection to your customers.

But for the purchaser, the challenges of standing up the carve-out as an independent company can be even greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve said many times, your due diligence efforts before any merger, acquisition or carve-out should include a deep assessment of the seller’s IT infrastructure. For a carve-out, IT due diligence (ITDD) identifies all the people, processes, systems, data and integrations upon which the unit being carved-out relies for its daily operations. Even if these components could simply be excised from the seller’s infrastructure, it might not be wise. ITDD can also uncover deficiencies and opportunities for improvements in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these operational components have to be duplicated or replaced with standalone equivalents. In addition, the necessary data has to be extracted and loaded and the independent infrastructure verified if the carve-out is to stand up on its own. If gross inefficiencies were identified, recommended alternatives must be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the time, resources and cost required for these efforts is one tremendous value of ITDD. These elements can be factored into the total cost and schedule of the transaction to avoid surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the ITDD team identified all these items and an agreeable transitional service agreement (TSA) has been signed. Even so, the actual infrastructure portion of a carve-out is often slower than expected. Here’s why and how you can avoid it on your transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What slows the transition down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carve-outs don’t happen all at once, just because the parties sign the transaction. A TSA is critical, since the seller must provide the buyer a certain level of support over a defined period. Sometimes, though, the length and complexity of support required is underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built-in intent of extension
Sometimes a seller will agree to a shorter-than-needed transition period to make the deal more attractive. After that period, they are able to extend the support at a significant price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of interest
Even with best of intentions, at some point the seller just wants to get on with his own business. The seller’s level of support degrades, shifting more onto the shoulders of the buyer’s team. This in turn leads to a longer, more costly than expected transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex, highly-integrated systems
One of the most critical purposes of ITDD is to understand the nuts and bolts of the systems already in place. These are the systems from which the carve-out has to be excised. Systems and databases not easily separated or duplicated can make smooth and timely transitions difficult. This is especially true of homegrown, legacy and no longer supported applications. Either these have to be replaced altogether, or the new company has to maintain connectivity and support with the selling company for an extended period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitigating the risk of slow, expensive transitions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these factors can lead to unexpected costs and an extended transition period. Proper IT due diligence can’t predict if the seller will fall down on their end of the TSA bargain. But ITDD can provide you more accurate time and cost estimates for standing up the carve-out on an independent infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid potential cost and time overruns, select an IT due diligence team that’s also experienced in building out infrastructure from scratch. Then you can use the same provider to plan and execute the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

If your company is still untouched, consider yourself lucky. After all, Computer Weekly reports the “Locky” ransomware affected companies in at least 114 countries in the first quarter of 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets even worse. Just last month, cyber criminals spewed out almost 140,000 spam emails in just four days. Each email carried a new, “improved” variant called Zepto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware isn’t new, though. It has been around in various forms since 1989. Whatever its form, the goal of ransomware is always the same: the criminal wants money. Earlier forms used various ways to block users’ access to their files. But today’s ransomware packs some heavy-duty cryptography. With it, it encrypts all your files, making them truly unavailable, unless you pay the ransom, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you protect your company from Zepto or any of its cyber cousins? With the proper care, it’s possible. The following points should help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scareware vs. the real deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we said, ransomware has been around for years. Crypto ransomeware—the kind that encrypts your data with a so-far-unbreakable key—gets the most press. But there are many less harmful variants out there. Some are annoying, with popups claiming to hold your system hostage. Other make your system unusable by locking (or blocking) your screen. In both cases, your underlying data files remain untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-malware can detect and remove most scareware programs. The real problem is that nowadays people assume it’s crypto ransomware. The perpetrators are banking you’ll do just that: fall for their hoax and pay up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prevention starts with detection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scareware or the real thing, when it comes to ransomware we should heed the old adage. Yes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. But there’s no cure for crypto ransomware, save handing over the money. That means the best approach is to stop it before it gains a foothold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-malware software ranges from free versions like Malwarebytes to enterprise apps like Kaspersky and McAfee/Intel. Most desktop versions can scan for suspicious incoming email messages and quarantine them. Enterprise varieties do the same at the server level, stopping these messages before they arrive in the recipient’s inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These programs all provide a level of protection. Their effectiveness, however, depends on how often they update their threat signature database. Cyber thieves can churn out hundreds of ransomware variants in a matter of days. With enough of a disguise, the infected emails can pass right through a malware screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also configure corporate spam filters to block emails from unknown senders and domains. This might trap an occasional innocent email, of course. Over time the filters will learn what is and what is not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best defense is often the simplest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, ransomware is almost always delivered and spread via email. If your anti-malware and spam filters fail, there’s still a simple-but-effective line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education. Training. Security behavior policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train your employees to simply not click on attachments from unknown senders. Remind them often to delete unexpected emails and files—unopened—even from known sources. Share documents and content using a repository instead of attachments. These are all simple, low-tech preventative policies. Make sure your employees know and heed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping the infection in check—a few more tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all these barriers, someone in your organization can still open an infected file. Now what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more cunning ransomware likes to spread itself around. Some will scan your address book and send copies to others within the company. Some may probe the local network for other vulnerable targets. Using sophisticated monitoring and intrusion detection applications, you can detect activities like these. At the very least, these can alert you of suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the infected computer or server, there’s still hope left. Turn off the machines immediately. An effective data security plan should create periodic backups for every computer in your enterprise. This lets you wipe the affected devices and restore them from the appropriate backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inconvenient, perhaps. But it’s better than being held hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

With 2017 less than six months away, how close did they come?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today 35.8 percent of enterprises mix private and public computing resources in some fashion. In other words, the hybrid cloud. It’s expected to rise to 41 percent over the next five years. That doesn’t quite hit Gartner’s projection, but demand is growing 27 percent each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of reasons to adopt this approach is still evolving. If you’re not yet using a hybrid cloud infrastructure, here are eight of the most compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 Lower cost: The “obvious choice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been said before, but cloud computing can offer savings over traditional, on-premise infrastructure. With a private cloud, you get flexibility with more control, behind your own firewall. You’re ultimately constrained by your server farm’s capacity, though. The public cloud offers more elasticity. Adding the public cloud for as needed resources saves you the cost of adding and maintaining new on-premise equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 Elasticity: Dynamic resources for changing needs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public cloud provides temporary bursts of resources, computing power being the most noteworthy. For example, if you run payroll or billing twice a month, your processing needs spike at those times. The rest of the time those resources are idle. The public cloud’s elasticity allocates compute resources only as long as you need them. And you only pay for what you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3 Scalability: Real growth is lasting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is similar to elasticity, except the resources can remain available to you indefinitely. Do you offer a service that needs sustained heavy processing in real time? As business booms and the number of users goes up, so does your computing and storage needs. Unless you’re dealing with sensitive information, scale up with public cloud where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4 Segmentation: The right security for the right content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You curate, store and disseminate tremendous amounts of information every day. This includes documents and content of every kind. Your users are just as varied: employees, customers, business partners and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidential information, like intellectual property, is best stored on your private cloud. Public company information, webpages and collateral can be stored on the public cloud. Customer and partner data can move between the two, with various security methods to secure them. With the hybrid cloud, you pick the best location for storing and sharing different kinds of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5 Regulatory compliance: Keeping it private&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just as important to segment your company’s sensitive, regulated data. Besides keeping corporate data safe, there are strict regulations governing customer and financial data. These include protecting health information, banking data, Social Security numbers and much more. Store these in your private cloud, then let the public cloud handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6 Disaster recovery: Resuming normal operations faster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have your own internal implementation, what do you do when disaster strikes? A hybrid cloud infrastructure allows you to backup your infrastructure in the public cloud. It eliminates costly standby equipment that otherwise sits idle 99 percent of the time. With services like Paranet’s SimpleDR, you can failover any part of your infrastructure—from a single server to the entire company—in a matter of minutes. You can run your business in the cloud while executing your disaster recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#7 Rapid deployments: Spinning it up and tearing it down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid cloud let IT departments turn up (or down) new servers and networks in minutes, rather than days or weeks. Need a new server for a proof of concept or a test environment? Create one in the public cloud, using a simple control panel. Just don’t forget to decommission it when you’re done to avoid costly and messy sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#8 Legacy applications: Some things are better left where they are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, many enterprises have older, legacy applications, anything from databases to complex CRMs. These were built long before we imagined the cloud and may even no longer be supported. Yet these systems are still running. A hybrid cloud solution allows you to move applications to the cloud when and if they are ready. And you can leave your legacy systems where they are, until it’s time to retire them.&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 15 years, Jim has turned to Paranet to help his company with due diligence. Specifically, Paranet assesses the technological health of many of Thoma Bravo’s merger and acquisition candidates and, in many cases, performs the necessary work to get a company where it needs to be from an IT perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, we’ve explored a number of reasons why performing in-depth IT due diligence is a critical part of assessing a target company, including full disclosure of past information security breaches. In our conversation with Jim, he said the pervasiveness of security risks is perhaps the top reason IT due diligence should be standard practice for acquisition deals, regardless of industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When assessing a company’s IT health, you need to look beyond its ability to thwart an intrusion. Is your target capable of recovering after an information disaster strikes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disasters come in many shapes and sizes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jim said, probing a company’s information security past can be critical. If the company had recent breaches, you can still incur future costs. Plus, if the vulnerabilities haven’t been patched, hackers can exploit them again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But cyberattacks aren’t the only kind of information disasters. A natural or man-made disaster can ravage a facility, taking out an entire building and the infrastructure with it. Even more common are the “smaller” disasters. A failed power supply, a crashed disk array or jittering router can make whole segments of your network inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s cybercrime, Mother Nature, or just aging equipment, your acquisition must be prepared to react when disaster strikes. It’s crucial you know whether it has a documented and tested disaster recovery plan (DRP) to replace or repair the damaged infrastructure. Even more important is a business continuity plan (BCP) so it can resume normal operations and customer service—even if it takes weeks or more to rebuild a physical facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure is everything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your target doesn’t have a tested DRP and BCP, it might not be the end of the deal. It does, however, leave the buyer exposed. Without these plans, any one of these events (or dozens of others) could take your acquisition “offline” completely. You’ll want to put a DRP in place as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ll be integrating the acquisition into your existing operations, you might be able to extend your own DRP to cover the acquired infrastructure. It will take some time to migrate the target’s infrastructure into your own, of course. During the transition, you are vulnerable to an IT disaster, whether it’s a cyberattack, an electrical short or a lightning strike to a facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the company will continue to operate on its own, you’ll need to develop a new DRP and BCP. Don’t underestimate the cost, time and infrastructure involved in putting these plans in place and adequately testing them. Until they are implemented, a disaster will leave the business exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, the question is simple: if a disaster of any size strikes, can you afford the exposure, the downtime and the financial damages? These risks should be factored into your assessment, TSA and the price you are willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How quickly could you recover?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jim would tell you, Thoma Bravo is a firm believer in IT due diligence. He knows there are many facets to a thorough technology assessment. From scalability to software licensing, from cybersecurity to disaster recovery, you have to look under the IT hood to know if—or how quickly—that new acquisition can recover and resume operations when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your acquisition target doesn’t already have working plans for disaster recovery and business continuity, weigh the potential risks and costs before closing the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

Up to now, the adoption rate of cloud-based financial systems has been a modest 20 percent, lagging behind almost every other enterprise application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could be changing now, but only if service providers, software vendors and IT can give CFOs what they really want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal pressure mounts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ve discussed before, the role of the CIO has been changing. The CFO has gradually absorbed the lion’s share of the CIO’s budget and purchase approval authorities, as businesses insist technology initiatives mesh with their core business strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just having the authority to make technology purchases hasn’t spurred CFOs to adopt more technology in their own departments. This includes cloud-based alternatives to financial, planning, budgeting and accounting systems, despite persuasive arguments by their technical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one authority higher up the ladder that’s applying some pressure. According to CFO magazine, 70% of CEOs think their CFOs should invest in more cloud-based financial systems. Unfortunately, half of those same CEOs say their CFOs lack the knowledge and skills to select an appropriate technology solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outside play for the CFO’s heart&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s pressure from outside, too. With companies projected to spend over $23 billion on financial management software in 2016, the software vendors are making a big play for the CFO’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The players in this space are dividing their efforts between traditional installed applications. But given the mandates from upstairs, a CFO is likely to take a hard look at the latter. Some capabilities vendors are touting in their attempts to get a CFO to adopt their solutions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budgeting, including sales, production and technology
Enterprise resource management (ERP)
AP and AR management
Asset management
Cash flow, capital and expenditure management
Statement preparation (income, expense and balance sheet)
Reporting and predictive analytics (perhaps the most important newcomer)
What a CFO really wants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help CFOs make this decision, providers have to look at what they really want—at least from a cloud-based package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, they’re interested in the potential savings offered by cloud-based infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure delivers flexibility and scalability without requiring constantappropriations of new capital IT budget. And SaaS is updated frequently and incrementally, with less need for long-term license purchases and upgrades. Both require less maintenance than their on-premise counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to it than just cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFOs want a sense of control, not just over the funds but also over the information itself. They want data and analytics available on-demand. They want more oversight of budgets and expenditures, yes, but also the insights from reporting and analysis on the data collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, they want more than just managing the books for the current quarter and fiscal year; they want control over the future. That’s where the predictive analytics found in many SaaS financial packages comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering what a CFO wants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how is a CFO to choose? As mentioned earlier, many CEOs don’t trust their CFOs to make a sound, technology-related decision. That’s traditionally been IT territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the mandate from upstairs, choosing a cloud-based financial management solution will address many of the CFO’s needs. That means this technology initiative is clearly a high business priority. The best bet is to engage IT and a trusted managed service provider to help evaluate and choose the best SaaS solution available.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fortune magazine reports that while cloud adoption continues to skyrocket, there’s one big holdout in the enterprise: the chief financial officer.

More importantly, how many do your employees use that you aren’t aware of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to data from Cisco Systems, the average company uses a whopping 1120 cloud services, over 12 times more than the 91 estimated by CIOs. Using tracking software, the company gathered usage and activity data on customer-purchased network devices, then surveyed the CIOs of those same companies. Using unauthorized cloud-based apps—many of them consumer-grade—is part of a growing problem with shadow IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from using personal email addresses and social media, file-sharing apps account for the lion’s share of non-sanctioned employee activities, with Dropbox accounts being the most prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Employees need to get their jobs done, and the apps provided by company IT are either too restrictive, too clunky or just downright inconvenient to use. Employees expect what they’ve become used to on their personal devices. They want tools that make it quick and easy to do what they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How and where are they storing company data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox isn’t the only free service employees use to share files. And there’s nothing wrong with Dropbox as a service. It’s simply that the free, personal accounts are less secure than enterprise-grade apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data they are sharing—with themselves or with others—isn’t just emails and calendar events. It’s customer and employee data, including account numbers, home addresses, phone numbers and payment histories. If that wasn’t bad enough, it might also contain bank account, credit card or social security numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for sensitive company data. Besides people-oriented data, files containing budgets, sales forecasts and figures, revenues, funnel and opportunity data—even trade secrets—could end up in your employees’ personal Dropboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your data is moved to such a service, it gets copied to multiple locations, from server to desktop, from desktop to Dropbox, from Dropbox to mobile device. An employee can even access it from a friend’s computer, if it’s convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your sensitive files are now in a dozen physical locations, and you have no control over where it will end up next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to all that data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT might be less concerned if employees used Dropbox for Business. But that’s not the case. Unfortunately, that means IT is losing control over sensitive company information, all for the sake of employee efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example. An employee pushes files to her cloud folder, so she can access it from her smartphone and her home computer. Besides the fact that the file should never have left the corporate network, what happens to the file after she finished working on it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to assume a well-intentioned employee will delete the uploaded files as soon as the job’s done. But everyone knows the last thing most people think of is cleaning up their folders, at least not right away. That’s why our inboxes often have a zillion messages in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the employee does move the files to the trash, the problem remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that apps like Dropbox will “sync” between all those different devices. In theory, when a file is updated or deleted in one location, the same happens in all the rest, right? Most of the time, that’s what happens—unless the file is copied elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the file has:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left the company’s servers and network.
Been pushed to personal cloud-based folder.
Been replicated to multiple locations and devices.
Been moved, renamed, versioned or otherwise altered.
Completely left the company’s control.
And all because an employee could get the job done with less hassle by using a free, personal service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;File sharing that’s the best of all worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t magically retrieve sensitive information spread around in this fashion, but you can take steps to prevent a repeat of this scenario. The answer? Simply provide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private, cloud-based file storage safely inside the corporate firewall.
Desktop and mobile apps that look, act and perform like the consumer file-sharing apps employees have come to rely on.
App installation and access for both company and personal devices.
Many file-sharing apps out there provide pay services for business solutions. These offer more storage space and encryption, plus better controls for your IT department. But most employees don’t need extra space, and even with encryption, it’s still based on the public cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need certainty that your company data stays within your control, you need a solution built on your own private cloud. And while you can’t prevent someone using a personal file-sharing app, you can certainly discourage it by providing a private solution that’s just as simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Just how many cloud services does your company use?

In many aspects of life, that’s good advice. You can’t change the past, after all. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may be true in matters of the heart, but not in business. When you are examining a potential merger or acquisition, what you uncover during due diligence can make or break a deal. At the very least, it can affect the price you offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we discussed how in-depth IT due diligence is as critical as careful financial assessment when considering an M&amp;amp;A target. After all, you wouldn’t shrug off misrepresented SEC filings, improper accounting practices or declining market shares, would you? You can’t afford to ignore costly infrastructure problems that might be hiding in the data center either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s climate of cybercrime, there’s perhaps no pitfall as critical as knowing how the company has reacted to security breaches. Here are six reasons to examine your target’s past information security (or its lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 Uncovering patterns of security incidents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you have to determine the frequency of breaches over the last five years or so. How many malicious incidents has the company experienced? These may be either hi- or low-tech—anything from cyberattacks or denial-of-service attacks to a disgruntled employee stealing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to know whether the company has intrusion detection and remediation software in place. If not, it’s possible there have been additional attacks no one even knows about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 Have past breaches been contained?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the company has accurate records of these incidents, what has been done to contain each breach and limit its damage? The success of an attack often results from known (but unpatched) vulnerabilities in firewalls and other network equipment. If vendor patches haven’t been applied, another hacker can use it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the company uses active intrusion detection, how rapid and effective were both the detection and subsequent actions—automated and manual—to close the vulnerability and limit the damage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#3 Have all parties been notified?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the company required to publicly report security incidents and data breaches? This depends on the industry. Some—like government, finance and healthcare—have strict laws governing timely disclosure of breaches, especially where personal, financial or health data is concerned. Everyone is aware of HIPAA and HITECH regulations in the healthcare sector, but each industry has its own notification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure all breaches have been reported to the appropriate authorities—not to mention the affected persons or businesses. You may be required to report them in the future, not to mention be subject to penalties for them not being reported in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#4 Past breaches can mean future costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aftereffects of security breaches have a way of lingering. If you aren’t aware of how the target company dealt with past breaches, you may be liable for any unresolved or unpaid expenses associated with them. One example is the cost of ongoing credit monitoring for customers whose personal data was stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#5 Protecting yourself from future liability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often data theft and its aftermath mean a company is unable to renew its existing business insurance. These include liability, professional indemnity and E&amp;amp;O coverage. If the company has to find a new insurer because of perceived risk, the cost can be significantly higher. As the acquirer, being unaware of past breaches means you could face higher-than-expected premiums in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#6 Your reputation is on the line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other reasons aside, perhaps the worst damage a security indiscretion can inflict is to your reputation. You want to be seen as a trusted business partner, one customers can trust with their private information. You could find legacy trust—or mistrust—transferred to your company. And sometimes goodwill can take years to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you uncover past breaches, it doesn’t have to kill the transaction. Often just knowing the details allows the IT due diligence team to assess how much it will cost to repair the damage. That way you can either factor these costs into the offer, or at least know they are on the horizon for future budgets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">People often say you should let the past be the past, or let bygones be bygones.

These are typical needs of a small to medium businesses (SMBs) with little or in-house IT staff. But there’s far more to outsourcing IT than the basic services, no matter how comprehensive they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take migrations—what does that term include? Most people think of “data migration,” but underestimating what is involved in a “migration” can lead to higher costs, time and effort than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason you seek an MSP is because your current IT resources and assets are inadequate for your needs. They may need to be upgraded or replaced, and that requires more than just “moving some data around.” So, when you revamp your infrastructure, what else does “migration” really entail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New or replacement hardware&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your computing power is insufficient or storage is full or failing, you’ll need to upgrade or replace your servers and desktop equipment. If you simply expand memory or storage, you’ll experience nothing more than a short outage. But if the replacement is caused by age or capacity, you’ll have to migrate all existing data and user profiles to new machines. In some cases, a simple backup-and-restore will do the trick. But if the old and new hardware aren’t compatible, it gets more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of network and other infrastructure equipment. You can’t simply yank an old router from a rack, slide in a new one of a different make and model and expect it to work. You should plan for a lot of manual configuration to restore network operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading your software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with experience running a company knows the software supporting your operation requires periodic maintenance on everything from desktop office tools to invoicing, CRM, ERP and more. It’s pretty straightforward to update your users’ machines to the latest version of MS Office but not so simple to upgrade an enterprise application package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise upgrades can introduce new or unrecognized features requiring up-front user training. They also require lengthy project plans, including custom coding to migrate existing functionality and database schemas to the latest version of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating to a new software application&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the latest version of vendor software doesn’t always provide the functionality you need. That’s when you evaluate and decide on a competing package. For example, while you might like Open Office, you need to migrate users to Microsoft Office to leverage your new Exchange Server. These applications are quite different, but they use the same file formats, making the switch “easy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When moving from one enterprise billing or CRM application to another, though, the underlying data formats and schemas are completely dissimilar. To provide continuity for users and customers, you have to somehow migrate the configurations, data and history from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating to the cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about efforts required to migrate to new hardware and software. But what if you are replacing your physical infrastructure with a virtual one by moving to the cloud? Using cloud-based infrastructure can provide enormous benefits once you make the switch. However, migrating the physical devices and configurations to mirror a familiar environment take some effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides moving data from physical to virtual storage (and protecting it), you might be changing from local desktop installations to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Some vendors provide both local and virtual versions of their apps (like MS Office). But if not, you’ll have to make your old application data available to a new, cloud-based app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email and other Office productivity apps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know migrating Microsoft Server applications from one major version to the next can be a serious undertaking? Unlike the desktop productivity apps, migrating server applications can be very tedious and technical. This includes (but isn’t limited to) products like Active Directory, Exchange Server and SharePoint. Each of these migrations affects your end users; desktops, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies put off these updates until long after the vendor has published one or even more major versions. This delay further complicates data and user migration, requiring more time and expertise to complete them successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy systems and more data migration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most difficult and underestimated migrations happens when you retire a legacy system. These systems are often proprietary and “closed,” meaning neither the functionality nor the data conform to any standards. There may not even be a usable data export function. This makes migrating features, data and users to a new vendor application far more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t underestimate your migration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most migrations—systems, apps and data—aren’t plug-and-play operations, even if the respective vendors advertise them as such. If you are attempting them on your own, don’t underestimate the time and effort required. Better yet, engage a trusted professional services company to handle everything for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When you think of hiring a managed service provider (MSP), you often think of computer and user management, storage capacity, networking and security.
